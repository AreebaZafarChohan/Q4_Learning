# 🛠️ Task 09: Understanding Tool Calling / Function Calling in LLMs

## 🔍 What is Tool Calling / Function Calling?

**Tool Calling** (also known as **Function Calling**) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to **invoke external tools, functions, or APIs** when needed to complete a user’s query more accurately.

Instead of just generating text, the LLM can say:
> “I don’t know the answer directly, but I know which function/tool to call to get it!”

---

## 🧠 Why is Tool Calling Important?

- Enhances **reasoning and problem-solving**
- Allows **real-time information retrieval** (e.g., weather, live data)
- Integrates **LLMs with real-world software & APIs**
- Enables **hybrid AI systems** (LLMs + Tools)

---

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

1. **Schema Definition**  
   Developer defines tool/function schemas (name, parameters, types).

2. **User Query**  
   User asks a question (e.g., “What's the weather in Karachi?”)

3. **Model Decision**  
   LLM analyzes the query and determines which tool/function to call.

4. **Tool Execution**  
   The specified function/tool is executed with given parameters.

5. **LLM Response**  
   LLM uses the tool’s output to generate a final, accurate response.

## 🧪 Example

```json
User: "Convert 500 PKR to USD"

LLM calls:
{
  "function": "convertCurrency",
  "parameters": {
    "from": "PKR",
    "to": "USD",
    "amount": 500
  }
}

Tool returns: 1.78 USD  
LLM says: "500 PKR is approximately 1.78 USD."
```

## 🔧 Where is Tool Calling Used?

- **Chatbots & AI Assistants**  
  _e.g., ChatGPT with plugins, custom tools_

- **Customer Support Bots**  
  _e.g., checking order status_

- **E-commerce Assistants**  
  _e.g., filtering products_

- **Finance Tools**  
  _e.g., currency conversion, stock prices_

- **Healthcare Assistants**  
  _e.g., symptom checker_

## 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ More accurate, dynamic responses  
- ✅ Bridge between LLM and real-world data  
- ✅ Safer — avoids hallucination by relying on factual tools  
- ✅ Can chain multiple tools together for complex tasks  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges

- 🔐 **Security**: Tools must be validated to avoid misuse  
- 🕒 **Latency**: Depends on tool/API response time  
- 🧩 **Complexity**: Requires good design of function schemas  
- ❌ **Fallbacks**: Model must handle tool errors properly

## 🌐 Future of Tool Calling

- 🔗 Seamless integration with **databases, APIs, devices**  
- 🤖 Powerful **AI agents** capable of multi-step planning  
- 🌍 Integration with **IoT**, **AR/VR**, **voice assistants**, and **robotics**
