# 🧠 Task 08: What is an LLM?

## 🌐 What is an LLM?
LLM stands for **Large Language Model** — a type of AI designed to understand, generate, and interact using human language. These models are trained on massive datasets using deep learning.

### Core Capabilities:
- Understand context & intent
- Generate and summarize text
- Translate languages, write code, and more

---

## 🔍 How Does it Work?

1. **Training Phase**  
   Trained on large text datasets (books, websites, etc.) to predict next words/tokens.

2. **Architecture**  
   Built on **Transformer** models with attention mechanisms.

3. **Fine-tuning**  
   Further refined using **human feedback** (e.g., RLHF).
